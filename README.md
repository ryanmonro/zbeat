# zbeat
Drum machine utilising zdog for the interface

I hammered this together pretty quickly, just to see how zdog behaved in a musical context. The rest is CR-78 samples, Tone.JS and gradients.
It looks great and things rotate but so far the zdogs being in time with the sequencer is a bit unpredictable.
